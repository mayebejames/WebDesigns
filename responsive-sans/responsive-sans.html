    <h1>Responsive sans</h1>

    <p>So far, I have sunk seven years into my attempt to understand medicine. Six in the libraries and lecture theatres and now one on the shop floor. To show for this I have a certificate to practice, a few polyester gowns, and several thousand pages of notes. Meticulous, exhaustive notes from the first year and half with laboriously hand drawn graphs. Scrawled scraps of essay plans from the terrible eighteen months that followed. In my first clinical year I used 80-page pocket notebooks in an attempt to glean whatever I could from the consultant's musings on the ward round; indecipherable 'nuggets' written while hurrying along corridors. In fifth year I moved to my laptop. The fragmented course was nothing compared to my chopping-and-changing with notetaking software: a year's output lost. For Finals I followed the sea of laptop screens in the tense and packed out lectures and used OneNote. It worked excellently, although now that I no longer have university access my hold over my notes is increasingly tenuous. Six years of learning and writing about everys facet of medicine from the ion channel to sarcoidosis and only a tiny fraction is accessible and usable.

    Since graduating, I've written everything in Markdown and spent whole days reading about Zettelkasten and Evergreen Notes. I've designed websites to house my notes and created a simple static site builder. I've written tiny, atomized notes each outlining a new concept or idea that I'd had and I've written exhaustive summaries of important conditions. My notes are now portable and can be accessed from a hospital PC but remain neither usable nor useful. I've spent too much time on metadata and theory; going from a quick note to something usable is too cumbersome, so polishing immediately fell behind naive note creation. A distinct, concerted effort to make my notes more than the sum of their parts and I again am presented with a jumble of tidbits in a heap.

    Compared to the serif, fusty designs that have preceded it, this is a blinding blank slate. I'm always surprised that there's no obvious template for a simple, half-decently responsive web page which doesn't require a bloated framework or npm or an obnoxious html design. For myself at least, this will be that template. No opinionated nest of divs around the main body. Atomized navigation bars and any other additional features which can be  easily and obviously removed or reused. This will likely remain a (slightly more than) minimum viable product rather than a polished and perfected template for publishing on Hacker News; I've spent enough time already polishing 'tools' when I should have been doing real work.

        Here's to the real work. It's worth doing well.

    <blockquote>
        <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>

        <p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>

        <p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>
